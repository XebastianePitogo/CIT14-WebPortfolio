            <p>
                I won't say that TFT was mainly part of my life growing up but currenty I find it one of the most addicting game to pass the time
                (Highroll Gambles) and how intricate are the games mechanics are. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also do casual lifting for the sake of testing my body's limits
                once a week and probably want to get up from bed at 70 years old. Besides lifting, I want to jog and stictly do it during early
                morning or late evening- Mid Noon is a big no.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Drawing... I never knew when I developed my habit of drawing something but I did it when I was bored at house, school, or even outside
                during my leisure time until I probably got the hang of it and a few complimented my drawings especially Editorial cartooning. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And Lastly
                is Walking. A few people will probably find it funny but I really do enjoy walking especially when alone with an earphones, walking gave
                me familiarity to places I do not know of before and was the first reason that made me got into fitness. The euphoric feeling you'll get
                when looking at a view without any crowd always leaves a good impression of the places I have gone through when walking.
